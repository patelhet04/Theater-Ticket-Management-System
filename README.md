### Topic Details

**Background:**
The Theater Ticket Management System aims to enhance the process of booking tickets for movies, replacing traditional methods with a digital platform. This system is designed to provide real-time access to movie schedules, seat availability, and pricing, enabling users to make informed decisions conveniently. The implementation of this system benefits both customers and theater owners by improving occupancy rates, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

**Purpose:**

- **Informed Decisions:** Offer insights from sales and occupancy data to guide strategic planning.

**Scope:**
The scope of the Theater Ticket Management System database includes various capabilities required for an efficient ticketing system. It encompasses user registration and management, movie and showtime listings, seat selection and reservation, payment processing, and ticket confirmation. Additionally, administrative functions allow theater workers to adjust movie schedules, manage seating arrangements, and access sales and occupancy information.
